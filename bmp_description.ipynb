    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "```bayesmixedlogit``` can be used to fit mixed logit models using Bayesian\n",
    "methods -- more precisely, ```bayesmixedlogit``` produces draws from the\n",
    "posterior parameter distribution and then presents summary and other\n",
    "statistics describing the results of the drawing. Detailed analysis of\n",
    "the draws is left to the discretion of the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation of `bayesmixedlogit` follows [Train (2009, chap. 12)](https://eml.berkeley.edu/books/choice2.html), and details of how the algorithm works are described\n",
    "in [Baker(2014)](https://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=st0354).  A diffuse prior for the mean values of the random coefficients is assumed, and the prior distribution\n",
    "    on the covariance matrix of random coefficients is taken to be an identity inverse Wishart.  ```bayesmixedlogit``` uses the\n",
    "    ```Mata``` routines ```amcmc()``` (if not installed: ```ssc install amcmc```) for adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling from the\n",
    "    posterior distribution of individual level coefficients and fixed coefficients.  The data setup for ```bayesmixedlogit``` is\n",
    "    the same as for ```clogit``` (```ssc install clogit```).  Much of the syntax follows that used by [Hole (2007)](https://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=st0133) in development of the command ```mixlogit```.\n"

    "## Options\n",
    "\n",
    "**```group```**(_`varname`_) specifies a numeric identifier variable for choice occasions.  **```group```**() is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**```identifier```**(_`varname`_) identifies coefficient sets (those observations for which a set of coefficients apply).  Thus, when a person is observed making choices over multiple occasions, one would use **```group```**(_`varname`_) to specify the\n",
    "        choice occasions, while **`identifier`**(_`varname`_) would identify the person.  **`identifier`**() is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`rand`**(_`varlist`_) specifies independent variables with random coefficients.  The variables immediately following the dependent variable in the syntax are considered to have fixed coefficients (see the examples below).  While a model\n",
    "can be run without any independent variables with fixed coefficients, at least one random-coefficient independent variable is required for bayesmixedlogit to work.  **```rand```**() is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`draws`**(`#`) specifies the number of draws that are to be taken from the posterior distribution of the parameters.  The default is **`draws`**(`1000`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**`drawsrandom`**(#) is an advanced option.  The drawing algorithm treats each set of random coefficients as a Gibbs step in sampling from the joint posterior distribution of parameters.  In difficult, large-dimensional problems, it\n",
    "        might be desirable to let individual Gibbs steps run for more than one draw to achieve better mixing and convergence of the algorithm.\n",

    "**`drawsfixed`**(#) is a more advanced option.  The drawing algorithm treats fixed coefficients as a Gibbs step in sampling from the joint posterior distribution of parameters.  In difficult, large-dimensional problems, it might be\n",
    "        desirable to let this step in Gibbs sampling run for more than a single draw.  The default is **`drawsfixed(1)`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`burn`**(#) specifies the length of the burn-in period; the first # draws are discarded upon completion of the algorithm and before further results are computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`thin`**(#) specifies that only every #th draw is to be retained, so if thin(3) is specified, only every third draw is retained.  This option is designed to help ease autocorrelation in the resulting draws, as is the option jumble,\n",
    "        which randomly mixes draws.  Both options may be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`araterandom`**(#) specifies the desired acceptance rate for random coefficients and should be a number between zero and one.  Because an adaptive acceptance-rejection method is used to sample random coefficients, by specifying the\n",
    "desired acceptance rate, the user has some control over adaptation of the algorithm to the problem.  The default is **`araterandom`**(.234).\n",

    "**`aratefixed`**(#) specifies the desired acceptance rate for fixed coefficients and works in the same fashion as **`araterandom(#)`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`samplerrandom`**(_`string`_) specifies the type of sampler that is to be used when random parameters are drawn.  It may be set to either global or mwg.  The default is **`samplerrandom`**(_`global`_), which means that proposed changes to random\n",
    "        parameters are drawn all at once.  If `mwg` -- an acronym for \"Metropolis within Gibbs\" -- is instead chosen, each random parameter is drawn separately as an independent step conditional on other random parameters in a nested\n",

    "\n",
    "**`dampparmfixed`**(#) works exactly as option **dampparmrandom**(#) but is applied to drawing fixed parameters.\n",

    "        of trying to achieve the acceptance rate specified in **`araterandom`**(#).  If the parameter is set closer to zero, adaptation is more gradual.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`from`(_`rowvector`_) specifies a row vector of starting values for all parameters in order.  If these are not specified, starting values are obtained via estimation of a conditional logit model via **`clogit`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`fromvariance`**(_`matrix`_) specifies a matrix of starting values for the random parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`jumble`** specifies to randomly mix draws.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`noisy`** specifies that a dot be produced every time a complete pass through the algorithm is finished.  After 50 iterations, a function value `ln_fc(p)` will be produced, which gives the joint log of the value of the posterior choice\n",
    "        probabilities evaluated at the latest parameters.  While `ln_fc(p)` is not an objective function per se, the author has found that drift in the value of this function indicates that the algorithm has not yet converged or has\n",
    "        other problems.\n",

    "**`saving`**(_`filename`_) specifies a location to store the draws from the distribution.  The file will contain just the draws after any burn-in period or thinning of values is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "**replace** specifies that an existing file is to be overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "**append** specifies that an existing file is to be appended, which might be useful if multiple runs need to be combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`indsave`**(_`filename`_) specifies a file to which individual-level random parameters are to be saved. More precisely, **`indsave`**(_`filename`_) saves the draws of the individual-level parameters. Caution: For long runs and models with large\n",
    "        numbers of individuals, specifying this option can cause memory problems. Users should be careful how it is used and consult some of the examples before employing the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`indkeep`**(#) is for use with indsave and specifies that only the last # draws of the individual-level random parameters be kept. This helps avoid excessive memory consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`indwide`** is for use with indsave and affords the user a degree of control over how individual-level parameters are saved. By default, individual-level parameters are saved in a panel form, meaning that each random parameter draw\n",
    "        is saved in a row, where draws are marked by the group identifier.  If instead the user would prefer that each row contain draws of each parameter, one could specify the indwide option, which saves all draws in a single row,\n",
